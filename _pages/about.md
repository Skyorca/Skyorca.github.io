I'm Boshen Shi, a fifth year Ph.D at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS) from successive Master's and Doctoral Program. I'm now supervised by Prof.Huawei Shen. 

My research interests include **graph transfer learning, graph data mining and social computing**. Selected first-auhor publications are listed as follows. You can find their detailed introductions  [here](https://academicpages.github.io/publications/).

[1]   *Node classification across networks via category-level domain adaptive network embedding*, **Knowledge and Information Systems** (2023).

[2]  *Improving Graph Domain Adaptation with Network Hierarchy*, **CIKM**’23

[3]  *OpenGDA: Graph Domain Adaptation Benchmark for Cross-network Learning*, **CIKM**’23 Resource Track

I'm holding the following trending github projects, which you may be interested in:

[1] [OpenGDA](https://github.com/Skyorca/OpenGDA ): The first tailored benchmark for evaluating Graph Domain Adaptation models with datasets and standardized SOTAs.

[2] [GDA Paper List](https://github.com/Skyorca/Awesome-Graph-Domain-Adaptation-Papers): 

[3] [Ref2bib](https://github.com/Skyorca/Ref2Bib): Given a list of paper titles, it generates the according bib file
